An informational website about why you should ask questions directly instead of
asking to ask.

Feel free to make pull requests with new translations or fixes to the existing
translations. When making new translations, you can add credit for yourself in
the footer of the translated page and in the list below. You can also add
yourself to the `CODEOWNERS` file if you want to review potential future
changes to the language you translated.
